# Implementing_linear_regression

This repository contains implementations of linear regression to fit data using a set of periodic (trigonometric) basis functions. The basis functions take the form of 1, sin(x), sin(k ∗x), sin(2 ∗ k ∗ x), ..., where k is the frequency increment. The goal is to find the best fit for the data by varying the "function depth" (d) and parameter vector Θ.
